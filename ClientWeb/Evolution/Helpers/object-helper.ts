    This method in use only for Reactive Form components. The deal is when you create for example FormGroup based on some
    item, you actually create FormGroup with the same structure, but you lose typing. And when it's time to extract data
    from those FormGroup you actually extract anonimous object with the same structure but without typing.

    Remark: even if you have FormArray as a first param you must send not Array, but type of item, because method can't
    Remark: get item's type(Ctor) any other way and Array doesn't provide it.
    Remark: If you cast literal object to array - you will get Array(0) without items, but with properties of literal
    Remark: object which must have been items of array! But with no items in array, it will be empty!

    Also possible to create mixings:
        ObjectHelper.cast<Constructable<T>, any>(<Constructable<T>><any>item1.constructor, item2);
    this code will use item1.constructor(not item instance - all the properties will be got from constructor initialization, not from item1 instance itself)
